1.  We need gameMap for whole routes do we already have
2.  Do we already ave the gameMap of our whole 200 station or do we need to make it manually
    As you all know there in the map there are some transport are available but in the map we don’t have the route so it can be a little inconsistent so the easy thing will be make the modifications in the game  
     map instead of changing our svg map.

3.  Our whole map should come on the screen we won’t need to scroll it down to see the bottom right stations
4.  We will have the zoomIn and zoom out feature
5.  All player stats should be together
6.  We Have to decide that do we have to explicitly should the log of myX in the end
7.  Choose the no of players with four I will show the all possible game over condition

I want you to generate the slides for how should the Scotland Yard board game should look like you have to include all the things like how can I put their badges how can I show their tickets remaining ticket
of each of the players and all the other things which you should think it should be there
