SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM sales 
GROUP BY product_id

I thought that product_id will be  primary key and I canâ€™t group by on product_id

SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS depart_AVGSALARY 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id

In further question you can add further clause also 

SELECT SUM(quantity), product_id
FROM sales
HAVING EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) = 2024
GROUP BY product_id ;

SELECT  COUNT(order_id) AS noOfOrders FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;

SELECT customer_id, SUM(purchase_amount) FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id

SELECT  customers.customerName, orders.OrdersID, Orders.ordersDate
FROM  Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders On  Customers.CustomersId = Orders.OrderId
Order By Customers.CustomerName
